# Image-Processing-Filters
This repository contains a C++ program that implements a variety of image processing filters for grayscale and color images. The filters perform operations such as converting images to black and white, rotating, flipping, merging, applying edge detection, and more. The program reads and writes BMP images using custom libraries.
